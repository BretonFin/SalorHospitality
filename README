#### Getting Started

1. Get source from github: `git clone git@github.com:michaelfranzl/billgastro.git`
2. You'll need Ruby 1.9.2. Inspect `Gemfile` to see which version of Ruby on Rails is currently used.
3. `cd billgastro`
4. Copy `config/database-default.yml` to `config/database.yml` and adapt your database settings
5. Create database: `rake db:create`
6. Migrate database: `rake db:migrate`
7. Load a basic dataset into the application: `rake db:fixtures:load`
8. Start server: `rails s`
9. Browse to `localhost:3000` and log in: login "admin", password "admin"


#### Usage

After you've logged in, you can click on the client logo on the top left of the screen. This opens up the admin menu and enables the dragging of the tables. When the admin menu is closed table dragging is disabled. The rest of the application is pretty self-explaining.


#### Notes

BillGastro is work in progress. The most recent version on github should work as it is.
