== Getting Started

1. Get source from github: `git clone git@github.com:michaelfranzl/BillGastro.git`
2. BillGastro ist tested for Ruby 1.9.2 (using rvm for Ruby management is suggested).
3. `cd billgastro`
4. Copy `config/database-default.yml` to `config/database.yml` and adapt your database settings
5. Create database: `rake db:create`
6. Migrate database: `rake db:migrate`
7. Load a basic dataset into the application: `rake db:fixtures:load`
8. Start server: `rails s`
9. Browse to `localhost:3000` and log in: login "admin", password "admin"


== Usage Hints

After you've logged in, you can click on the client logo on the top left of the screen. This opens up the admin menu and enables drag and drop of the tables. When the admin menu is closed, table dragging is disabled. The rest of the application is pretty self-explanatory.


== Notes

BillGastro is work in progress. The most recent version on github should work as it is and should contain very few bugs, if at all.
