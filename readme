Should provide help in the daily business of Restaurants, Bars, etc. This is not a plugin, it's a normal Rails application.

== Getting Started

1. Adapt database settings in "config/database.yml"
2. Create database with `rake db:create`
3. Migrate database with `rake db:migrate`
4. Load fixtures to have a basic dataset to begin with, `rake db:fixtures:load`
5. Start server `script/server`
6. The 'superuser' from the basic fixture data is username "su", password "su"

Have fun!
