# BillGastro: A POS (Point of Sales) Ruby on Rails Internet Application for your Restaurant or Bar

BillGastro helps you manage your daily business in Restaurants, Bars, etc. It is real world-tested in a restaurant in Vienna (since March of 2010) and continues to be used live. It has eye-candy graphics and was optimized for fast entering of sales (uses lots of js, minimal http requests).

# Getting Started

BillGastro is a Ruby on Rails 2.3 application. It probably runs on other Rails versions too.

1. Get source from github: `git clone git@github.com:michaelfranzl/billgastro.git`
2. `cd billgastro`
3. Adapt your database settings: `vim config/database.yml`
4. Create database: `rake db:create`
5. Migrate database: `rake db:migrate`
6. Load seed data to try the application: `rake db:fixtures:load`
7. Start server: `script/server`
8. Browse to `localhost:3000` and log in as superuser: login "su", password "su"


# Notes

BillGastro is work in progress. The version on github should work as it is.


# ToDo

BillGastro uses standard Rails I18n, but is only partially translated. It should not be too difficult to add the rest of the translations.
